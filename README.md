## The project

By and Buy is a simple web project. A first time experimentation with React builds. Basic data and DOM manipulation are applied in this project, such as add, modify and delete products. All products are fictional and the data verification is not on point.

## The demo

## The docs

## The installation

* copy project from github
* make sure node.js is installed on your machine
* get the dependencies, run -> **npm i** 
* start the server, run -> **npm start**
* for builds, run -> **npm run build**

## The techs

This project is built using React components and uses Tailwindcss for all the styling process. For mock server builds, json-server is used.

## The looks

The looks should be minimalist and resemble platforms for buying.
